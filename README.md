2D Proportional Navigation Sim: 

Plotting notebook for output of sim included.
User can set missile and target initial conditions in the 2d plane.
Target assume constant velocity, but allows normal acceleration for constant turn rates.
Sim also assumes no gravity, so dimensions would be crossrange and downrange.
Sim is run in C++. Time histories of all variables are logged.
